        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tortillas are unleavened flat breads made with corn or wheat flour, water, and salt.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Masa harina</li>
            <li>Hot water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, briefly whisk together masa harina and salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add 1 1/2 cups hot water, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula until an evenly-mixed dough begins to form. </li>
            <li>Use your hands to knead the dough for 2-3 minutes in the mixing bowl until it is smooth and forms a cohesive ball. </li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a damp kitchen towel (or paper towel) and let the dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon or a medium ice cream scoop to portion the dough into a 2-tablespoon ball then use your hands to roll the ball until it is nice and round.</li>
            <li>Place the dough ball between two pieces of plastic in a tortilla press. Then gently press the dough ball until it forms a 4- to 5-inch tortilla.</li>
            <li>Cook the tortilla for about 40-60 seconds per side, flipping it once speckled brown spots begin to appear on the bottom of the tortilla. </li>
